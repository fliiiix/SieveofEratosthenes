The sieve of Eratosthenes (in rust!)
=========================

In mathematics, the sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple,
ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. (source: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes))

Change `max_number` to controll the limit.
